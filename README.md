# Silent-Game

## Installation
1. To run this application on your computer, download [Processing](https://processing.org/download/).
2. Once you have Processing downloaded, clone my repository onto your computer and open Silent_Game_2.pde within the Processing 
application.
3. When you try to open that file, it automatically creates a folder with the same name as the file and places the file in 
there.
  - If you try to run the application with that single file, it will give you an error because none of the other files are found.
4. Next, make sure to transfer all the other files (Block.pde, Target.pde, mobamba.mp3, laser.jpg, etc.) into the folder 
that Processing automatically created and placed the first file in.
5. Once all the files are in the same folder, hit the play button in the Silent_Game_2.pde file in Processing and the game 
should run! :)
